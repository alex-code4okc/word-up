# Word Up

This application is a simple page with a textarea where all of the text should
be visible on whatever screen you're viewing the page without ever having to
scroll.

On top of that, the font size in the text area should be as large as possible,
but such that it still matches the above condition.

The use case for this application is kind of like a "billboard" for a speaker -
where you can use this web application to show them a little message from an
overhead monitor that they can read. The text needs to be as large as it can be,
without having to scroll.

## Tech

This application just uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript & jQuery. If you'd like to
remove jQuery and the application still works - be my guest!

It currently is not working as expected. - but it's close! Please, make it work!
